x a finished TODO item

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

x documentation on http://hamsterdb.com/public/scripts/html_www/modules.html:
    hamsterdb Cursor Functions is a child of hamsterdb Database Functions - but
    it should be on the same level!

x can we extend the statistic module to find out if a Database is sequential,
    and then decide to have late page splits when inserting keys?
    x make sure that ham_check_integrity does not find false positives
    x try to find better pivot values
        x also make sure that my_insert_split is only called if the merge
            makes sense - it's ok
        x also for optimized cursor-inserts with HAM_HINT_APPEND - no, it's ok
        x unittest for default splitting
        x what if HAM_DAM_SEQUENTIAL_INSERT is not specified? can we 
            optimize the pivot value?
            x unittest!
        x unittest for SEQUENTIAL INSERT and late splitting

x some warnings on the laptop (32bit, linux)
    bt_cursor.cpp:100: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
    bt_cursor.cpp:109: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
    bt_cursor.cpp:236: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
    bt_cursor.cpp:267: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules
    bt_cursor.cpp:294: warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules

x why is t allowed to have multiple (temp.) transactions??
    txn=db.begin()
    db.insert(a, b) -> should fail!
    x add unittests

x statistics.c: has big code about cach history which is only used in debug
    mode - remove it

x read hashing documents from Ger

x update the Java API 

x .NET unittests InsertFindCommit and others failing
    -- no, just with 1.1.3, not with 1.1.4!

x Windows: are the file mapping routines really ok? does the file mapping
    handle have to be created over the whole file size? does it have to be
    created with every mmap call??
    x why is the file size so huge? we do not store blobs (all records are
        < 8 bytes) -> the freelist is never needed!
        --> it's not the freelist; index pages are split very early and
            therefore are only 50% full
    x unix: in read-only files only map for reading, not for writing
    x create a test program on windows and linux:
        - create file
        - allocate a page (w/ mmap)
        - modify the page
        - unmap/delete the page -> flushed? it must not be flushed (unless
            it's flushed explicitely)
    x test with big file sizes on 32bit Windows - does it fail?
        http://support.microsoft.com/kb/177415 - yes
    x use FlushViewOfFile instead of writing file? - won't work because we
        use COW
    x CreateFileMapping: file size can be 0 (will then use the full file size)
    x for now we use 64k as mmap minimum pagesize - but that's not true.
        what is the real size?? -- no, 64k is the right one.
    x look up amount of available pool memory; then limit the
        caching to a reasonable size, and print a warning (only 32bit windows!)
        -> no, doesn't work because we do not know how much memory is used
            in the application itself; therefore: if this error appears then
            just fallback to read/write

x documentation for ham_get_parameters, ham_env_get_parameters is not
    sufficient
    -> need list of all parameters that are available

x there are some inconsistencies in the header file
    x HAM_PARAM_DBNAME -> HAM_PARAM_GET_DATABASE_NAME
    x HAM_PARAM_GET_DAM -> HAM_PARAM_GET_DATA_ACCESS_MODE
    x sort the functions and the constants - list constants AFTER
        the first function that they're used for; really have separate
        doxygen sections for each of the groups??

x disallow use of HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS with HAM_SORT_DUPLICATES???
    --> no, but add FAT warning to header file!

o fix freelist page overflow when searching for bits (See mail from Stefan)


o update the .NET API 



o also look at Ger's sources

o update the Python API 

. create abstraction layer for local Environments/Databases and remote
    Environments/Databases
    o move every local function to local.c

. network-server (use apr, protocol buffers)

    i.e. use mongoose?

. network-client (use apr, protocol buffers)

. pure java network client

. WinCE: create and run Unittests project
    http://msexchangeteam.com/archive/2004/02/23/78930.aspx
    o also, we could use mmap (which is currently disabled)

. some tests in filter.cpp are deactivated - fix them

. run profiling for duplicate tests - can things be improved?
    o blob_overwrite/duplicate table handling: in some cases we can use
        HAM_DIRECT_ACCESS to speed up things (at least for in-memory)

. webpage changes
    http://www.purenetworks.com/
    http://www.omegathemes.com/tf/smartages/#
    http://eucalyptus.com/
    x the header page image is too large
    o frontpage: have multiple images (scrolling in background) with more
        text info? 
        http://malsup.com/jquery/cycle/basic.html
        http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/examples/image-slider/
        http://www.slidedeck.com/
    o sitemap: pulldown with jquery
    o download: need download gates to track in analytics as goals
    o rss feed

. improve documentation/tutorial/faq about
    o confluence is too slow on this server :( Need something else...
    o move some of the documentation and tutorial to a Wiki
        o tutorial (remove from doxygen)
        o samples (remove from doxygen)
        o faq (remove from doxygen)
        o internal developer documentation (remove from doxygen)
    o tutorial/faq: add hinting flags
    o tutorial/faq: add DAMs

. add automatic code coverage using gconv
    http://www.manpagez.com/man/1/gcov/
    http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html
    http://aleccolocco.blogspot.com/2009/08/sqlite-lesson-in-low-defect-software.html (section "Test Coverage with GCC")
    o track coverage results, publish online
    o gui tools: http://code.google.com/p/trucov/,
                 http://sourceforge.net/projects/ggcov/files/ 

. remove HAM_HINT_UBER_FAST_ACCESS, HAM_HINT_RANDOM_ACCESS, HAM_HINT_SEQUENTIAL

. ham_flush: deprecate, replace w. ham_env_flush? it's already implemented
    o need unittests!?

. evaluate if we can use bamboo for building and testing on multiple
    platforms
    o http://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/features/elastic.jsp#remote
    o install server
    o setup several agents (win32, win64, linux x86, linux x86_64, ...) and
        run either all or only some of the tests, including valgrind!

o need tool to upgrade databases from 1.0.x to 1.1.x!

. ham_get_parameter: could return VERSION of the database

. approx. matching: need a sample

. Ger: can specify an initial file size

. how can we merge our ACID transactions/recovery prototype?
    - simplify insert algorithm
    - STRONGLY simplify erase algorithm
    - get rid of the physical logfile
    - use a logical logfile with the current txn implementation
    ----------
    - move limited txn implementation to rb-trees in memory
    ----------
    - add the full ACID stuff

. merge threadsafe code

. HighLevelTxnTest::rollbackHugeBlobTest is inactive because huge blobs are
    directly written to disk instead of going through the cache -> in case of
    a txn_abort, these blobs are not reallocated

. win32: check Ger's solution - he can handle multiple msvc versions

. Perl wrapper

. PHP wrapper
