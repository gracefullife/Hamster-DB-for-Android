The Win32 build environment is a Solution file for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 
(win32/hamsterdb.sln). It compiles a dynamic library.

All libraries and executable files are built in the 'out'-directory. 
Intermediate files are in the 'tmp'-directory.

The dynamic library is built in 'out/dll[_debug][_x64]/hamsterdb-java.dll'. 
Import libraries and pdb files for debug builds are also provided. 

All libraries can be downloaded separately from the hamsterdb webpage.

For dependencies, hamsterdb-java needs the Sun Java Developer Kit (JDK), 
which can be downloaded from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp,
and the hamsterdb DLL, which can be downloaded from www.hamsterdb.com either
as Source package or prebuilt Win32 libraries. You will have to modify the 
Solution properties, and change the include paths and library dependencies 
accordingly.

To download Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition for free, go to
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/default.aspx.

To test and run hamsterdb for Java, follow these steps:

1. Use Microsoft Visual Studio to build the wrapper DLL; the project will
    automatically copy the DLL to the `java'-directory.
2. Open cmd.exe and change to the `java'-directory.
3. Run `win32.bat' - this batch file will create the JAR file with the
    compiled Java objects. To use the batch file, make sure that the 
    environment variable JDK is set properly.
4. To run the samples, change to the `samples'-directory, and start `win32.bat'.
    Make sure that `hamsterdb-java.dll' is in the path or in the current
    directory.
5. To run the unittests, change to the `unittests'-directory, and start 
    `win32.bat'. Make sure that `hamsterdb-java.dll' is in the path or in 
    the current directory.
