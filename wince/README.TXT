The Windows CE build environment is a Solution file for Microsoft 
Visual C++ 2005 (wince/hamsterdb.sln). It compiles a static and 
a dynamic library, and a few samples.

The project files are configured to work ONLY with the Windows CE x86 
reference platform. (!)

If you want to compile hamsterdb for other platforms, you have to modify the
project settings accordingly.
